# Student Grade Table

This grade table has a log in for both teachers and students. Teachers are able to create, edit, and delete grade listings. Students are able to see their current report card and request and emailed copy. This grade table is not associated with Cal Poly Pomona, the images and colors are a homage to my alma mater.
